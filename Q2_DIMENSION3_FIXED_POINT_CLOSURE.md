# q=2 -> exact causal-volume dimension-three fixed point

Status: **exact asymptotic scaling theorem for the frozen q=2 route rewrite, cross-checked by structurally distinct PL-topology and diffusion/scaling observables that share upstream route-family assumptions**.

This note closes the specific “dimension gradient” that had previously appeared only numerically as

```text
... -> 2.9517 -> 2.99385 -> 2.999229782 -> ...
```

The limit is not guessed from a fit. Once `q=2` has been fixed upstream by the local binary homogeneity equation

\[
q+2=2^q,
\]

the frozen route rewrite has an analytic growth law whose unique infrared causal-volume exponent is exactly three.

The qualifier **upstream** matters.  The equation `q+2=2^q` is a declared local valence-homogeneity requirement of the chosen route family.  Its solution is exact inside that family, but the requirement itself is an architectural/model-selection assumption unless a deeper microscopic theorem derives it.

## 1. Upstream microscopic input: q=2

The local selector is

\[
q+2=2^q.
\]

For integers `q>=1` its unique solution is

\[
\boxed{q=2}.
\]

Therefore the number of route midpoints created per active causal edge is

\[
B=2^q=4.
\]

This value is frozen before any dimension measurement below.  That prevents fitting `q` to the desired exponent, but it does **not** make every downstream q=2 consequence statistically independent of every other one.

---

## 2. Exact recursive growth law

In one generation every active causal edge produces `B` intermediate route vertices and two causal child edges per route. Therefore

\[
E_{g+1}^{\rm active}=2B\,E_g^{\rm active}.
\]

For `q=2`,

\[
\boxed{2B=8}.
\]

The causal graph distance between the original boundary vertices doubles per generation,

\[
L_{g+1}=2L_g.
\]

Starting from one active edge with two endpoint vertices, the exact vertex count is

\[
N_g
=2+B\sum_{r=0}^{g-1}(2B)^r
=2+B\frac{(2B)^g-1}{2B-1}.
\]

For `B=4`,

\[
\boxed{N_g=\frac{4\,8^g+10}{7}}.
\]

No continuum fit is used in this identity.

---

## 3. The finite-step dimension gradient

Define the one-step causal-volume exponent by comparing consecutive generations,

\[
d_g
=\frac{\log(N_g/N_{g-1})}{\log(L_g/L_{g-1})}
=\log_2\frac{N_g}{N_{g-1}}.
\]

Substituting the exact `q=2` counts gives

\[
\boxed{
d_g
=3+\log_2\left(
1-\frac{35}{16\,8^{g-1}+40}
\right).
}
\]

Hence for every finite `g>=2`,

\[
d_g<3,
\]

and because the positive correction in the logarithm decreases monotonically,

\[
d_{g+1}>d_g.
\]

Therefore

\[
\boxed{d_g\nearrow3}.
\]

Representative values are

| generation `g` | `d_g` |
|---:|---:|
| 2 | 2.662965012722429 |
| 3 | 2.951744831392779 |
| 4 | 2.993853015664851 |
| 5 | 2.999229782139151 |
| 6 | 2.999903693848493 |
| 7 | 2.999987961279020 |
| 8 | 2.999998495152814 |

The previously frozen held-out causal-volume value

\[
\boxed{d_H=2.999229782139151}
\]

is therefore not an isolated numerical coincidence: it is the `g=5` point of this exact monotone sequence.

---

## 4. The fixed point is exactly three

As `g -> infinity`, additive boundary terms in `N_g` become irrelevant and

\[
\frac{N_g}{N_{g-1}}\to 2B=8.
\]

Consequently

\[
\boxed{
d_*^{\rm causal-volume}
=\log_2(8)
=3.
}
\]

Equivalently, for general frozen `q`, the same route rule has

\[
\boxed{d_*^{\rm causal-volume}=\log_2(2^{q+1})=q+1.}
\]

Thus `d*=3` is an exact theorem of the frozen route rewrite once `q=2` is supplied.  It is not inserted by choosing a three-dimensional lattice.  It is, however, algebraically downstream of the q-selector, so the logical strength of the result depends on the status of the valence-homogeneity rule that selected `q=2`.

## 5. Structurally different checks and their common cause

The project has several mathematically different constructions that point to spatial dimension three.  They should be distinguished from statistically independent observations.

### A. Exact local topology

The q=2 route shell is an octahedral

\[
S^2.
\]

A vertex of a combinatorial three-manifold has an `S^2` link.

### B. Exact selected global PL completion and stability

The canonical minimal+flag completion is the boundary of the 16-cell,

\[
M^3\cong S^3,
\]

with

```text
(V,E,F,T) = (8,24,32,16)
Betti     = (1,0,0,1)
```

and recursive barycentric refinement preserves all vertex/edge/face link conditions through the tested levels

```text
16 -> 384 -> 9216 tetrahedra.
```

### C. Dynamical/scaling observables

The frozen route calculation separately gives

\[
\boxed{d_H=2.999229782139151},
\qquad
\boxed{z=0.998281156\ \text{(rounded project value)}}.
\]

In the repository code, the quantity historically labelled `ds_slice_holdout` is already the ratio

\[
\boxed{
d_{\rm eff}^{\rm slice}
\equiv\frac{d_H}{z}
\simeq3.004393867.
}
\]

This notation matters: `3.004393867` has **already been divided by `z` once**. It must not be divided by `z` again.

Together with the exact causal-volume limit,

\[
\boxed{
D_{\rm topo}=3,
\qquad
d_{\rm causal-volume}\to3,
\qquad
d_{\rm eff}^{\rm slice}\simeq3.00439,
\qquad z\simeq1.
}
\]

These checks use different mathematics and can catch different implementation failures.  However they are not all statistically independent because the local `S^2` shell, selected `S^3` completion and exact `d*=q+1` growth law share the same upstream q=2 route architecture.  Their agreement is therefore **internal cross-consistency**, not a multiplication of independent evidential probabilities.

A stronger independent geometrogenesis test would generate an ensemble from a dimension-blind frozen microscopic dynamics and measure topology/diffusion/volume exponents without conditioning the construction on the q=2 completion.

---

## 6. From three spatial dimensions to 3+1 scaling

The frozen route code defines the one-causal-time history exponent as

\[
\boxed{
d_{\rm eff}^{\rm history}
=1+\frac{d_H}{z}
=1+d_{\rm eff}^{\rm slice}.
}
\]

With the frozen held-out values,

\[
\boxed{
d_{\rm eff}^{\rm history}
\simeq4.004393867.
}
\]

This is the internally consistent project convention.

A separate continuum heat-kernel formula is sometimes written

\[
d_s^{\rm history}=1+\frac{D}{z},
\]

where `D` denotes the primitive spatial volume/Hausdorff dimension. If one calls `D/z` itself a spatial spectral exponent, then the equivalent formula is simply

\[
d_s^{\rm history}=1+d_s^{\rm slice}.
\]

The two forms are the same statement with different notation; applying `/z` to `d_H/z` a second time would double-count the dynamical exponent.

Thus the strengthened dimension chain is

\[
\boxed{
q=2
\to S^2\ \text{local link}
\to M^3\cong S^3\ \text{selected PL phase}
\to d_{\rm causal-volume}=3\ \text{fixed point}
\to d_H/z\simeq3.00439
\to z\simeq1
\to 3+1\ \text{IR scaling}.
}
\]

This is a coherent chain of consequences and checks.  It is not a chain of statistically independent measurements at every arrow.

## 7. Exact scope and non-claims

The theorem proved here is the asymptotic **causal-volume exponent of the frozen q=2 route rewrite** relative to its causal depth scale.

It does not by itself prove that every graph metric, every possible nonflag global gluing, or every interacting quantum ensemble has Hausdorff dimension three. The repository therefore keeps the PL-link, diffusion/scaling and Hodge/two-form calculations as **separate falsification gates**, while recognizing that some share upstream assumptions and are not statistically independent.

Likewise, the existence/stability of the canonical `S^3` PL completion is not a theorem that the bare causal graph uniquely forces that gluing.

The scientific strength comes from exact conditional theorems, structurally different failure modes and preregistered tests — not from counting correlated consequences as independent evidence.
